# CODSOFT Internship Projects  

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Data Science & Machine Learning internship under CODSOFT.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction  
- Built a machine learning model to predict survival of passengers on Titanic.  
- Applied data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models.  

### Task 2: Sales Prediction  
- Built a regression model to predict sales based on advertising and campaign data.  
- Performed feature engineering and evaluated regression models.  

### Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection  
- Built a machine learning model to classify fraudulent vs genuine credit card transactions.  
- Applied preprocessing, SMOTE for class imbalance, and tested Logistic Regression & Random Forest.
